The project aims to analyze the effect of reviews of Yelp incluencers on overall ratings and reviews of businesses. The analysis informs business owners of potential benefits of inviting Yelp influencers to visit the business and to write reviews.

We picked top 5% if Yelp influencers (or Yelp elites) and filtered out businesses that they reviewed. For each business, we looked at all reviews 1 month before and 1 month after the influencer visited the business and investigated the change in the number of reviews and average ratings.
